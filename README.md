# 🧠 Fraud Detection with Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This machine learning project detects fraudulent financial transactions using four supervised learning algorithms. It was completed as a team capstone for CMPS 4700.

Our application reads raw transaction data, preprocesses it, trains models, evaluates performance, and allows saved models to be reused.

## 🧑‍💻 My Role
I served as the **team leader**, responsible for:
- Coordinating project structure and task assignment
- Implementing and testing multiple ML models
- Organizing the GitHub repo and project workflow
- Writing the main integration code

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- scikit-learn, Keras, NumPy, Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- GitHub

## 🧪 Models Implemented
- ✅ K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- ✅ Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- ✅ Decision Tree (DT)
- ✅ Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

## 📂 Dataset
- Simulated financial transaction data
- Features include transaction amount, type, location, and label (fraud or not)

## 📈 Model Performance
*(Metrics from the final evaluation — update later if needed)*

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|-------|----------|-----------|--------|
| KNN   | 88%      | —         | —      |
| SVM   | 90%      | —         | —      |
| DT    | 85%      | —         | —      |
| ANN   | 92%      | —         | —      |
